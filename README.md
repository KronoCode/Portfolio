###### HMI and control of microprocessors PICOGRID:
```
Realization of a scale model of a house powered by solar panel. Identification of the needs, implementation of an HMI and sizing of the system: solar panel, MPPT, battery.
```
My role in the project was to program the microcontrollers to :

* Display and use the battery level to switch to "Low Power Mode".
* Program double PWMs to control transistors which will allow us to turn off power outlets or other features.
* Pass information between microcontrollers by using i2C bus.
* Display information on a 2x16 LED screen.
